# TradingView MCP Market Data & Technical Analysis for AI Assistants

<a href="https://trendshift.io/repositories/25110" target="_blank"><img src="https://trendshift.io/api/badge/repositories/25110" alt="atilaahmettaner%2Ftradingview-mcp | Trendshift" style="width: 250px; height: 55px;" width="250" height="55"/></a>

**TradingView MCP server** — real-time market data, technical indicators, screeners, and backtesting for Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot, and any MCP client. Stocks, crypto, forex & futures across global exchanges.
Backtesting + live sentiment + Yahoo Finance + 37 technical-analysis tools — the most complete TradingView MCP toolkit, all in one server.

</p>

**🆕 The hosted server now draws.** Ask for a chart and an interactive candlestick view (1d / 1h / 15m, optional Bollinger overlay) renders live **inside the conversation** via MCP Apps — and the AI reads the band values back to you:

</p>

**Paste one URL (or `pip install`), then just ask.** Real output, straight from the live server:

> [!NOTE]
> **Does it need — or risk — your TradingView account? No.** This server does **not** log into, scrape, or automate a TradingView session, and it requires no TradingView account or API key. Market data is fetched server-side from public endpoints, so there is no account of yours in the loop and no browser/UI automation. *(This is different from MCP servers that drive the TradingView Desktop app via Chrome DevTools.)* You are responsible for ensuring your own use complies with the terms of any data source you point it at.

<details>
<summary><b>How this compares to desktop-automation TradingView MCPs</b> (the ones that remote-control TradingView Desktop)</summary>
<br>

"TradingView MCP" now means two very different kinds of project. Both are useful — for different jobs:

| | **This project — data & analysis API** | **Desktop-automation MCPs** |
|---|---|---|
| What you need | Nothing — public market data | TradingView Desktop, usually with a paid TradingView plan |
| Where it works | Claude.ai, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Copilot — any MCP client | Mostly Claude Code, on your own machine |
| When your machine is off | Hosted version keeps answering, 24/7 | Stops |
| Screeners & backtesting | Built in (37 tools, multi-exchange) | Whatever the TradingView UI offers |
| Charts | Interactive in-conversation charts (MCP Apps, hosted) | TradingView's own charts |
| Your TradingView account | Not needed, never touched | Drives your logged-in session |

If you want an AI clicking around *your* TradingView Desktop — editing Pine Script, drawing on charts, using replay — check out [tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp](https://github.com/tradesdontlie/tradingview-mcp). If you want headless market data, screeners and backtesting available to any AI client, with nothing installed and no TradingView account in the loop — that's this project.

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Not financial advice.** Nothing produced by this software is investment, financial, legal, tax, or accounting advice. tradingview-mcp is an informational and educational analysis tool. Its outputs, including indicators, scores, signals, "trade setups", entries, stop losses, and targets, are computed from third party market data and are **not** recommendations to buy, sell, or hold any asset. It does not execute trades, manage money, or guarantee any result. Trading and investing carry a substantial risk of loss, and you can lose some or all of your capital. Always do your own research and consult a licensed professional before making any financial decision. You are solely responsible for your own decisions and for complying with the laws and regulations that apply to you. Market data may be delayed, inaccurate, or incomplete, and is provided without warranty.

> [!TIP]
> **Prefer zero setup? Use the hosted version.** [**pro.cryptosieve.com**](https://pro.cryptosieve.com) serves all 37 tools as one connector URL for Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Copilot, and Cursor — no `uv`, `pandas`, or Python to wrangle. **From $9/mo (Pro) or $29/mo (Pro+ — higher limits), with a 3-day free trial.** Self-hosting stays free forever; hosted is just for folks who'd rather skip the ops. *(Full self-host vs hosted comparison in Quick Start below.)*

## 🆕 What's New

**Stability & Strategy Expansion (May 2026)**

- **Async hot-path tools** — 7 high-traffic tools (`yahoo_price`, `stock_extended_hours`, `top_gainers`, `volume_breakout_scanner`, `multi_timeframe_analysis`, `financial_news`, `combined_analysis`) converted to `async def`. FastMCP runs sync tools serialized on the event loop — async unlocks real intra-server parallelism so concurrent tool calls actually overlap. `combined_analysis` additionally fans its 3 sub-calls out via `asyncio.gather` for ~3× wall-clock improvement on the power tool. `yahoo_price` / `stock_extended_hours` use `httpx.AsyncClient` for true non-blocking I/O; sync-library tools (`tradingview_ta`, `tradingview-screener`, `feedparser`) are off-loaded via `asyncio.to_thread`. *(PR — open)*
- **9 backtest strategies** (up from 6) — added `rsi_pullback`, `keltner_breakout`, and `triple_ema`, covering trend-pullback, ATR-normalized breakout, and SMA200-filtered EMA cross edges. `compare_strategies` now ranks the full 9.
- **Resilience layer** — automatic retry + 60-second TTL cache on the TradingView screener provider, eliminating transient `"Expecting value"` errors on `combined_analysis` and `multi_timeframe_analysis`. *(PR [#32](https://github.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp/pull/32) — merged)*
- **Financial news service rebuild** — replaces deprecated Reuters RSS endpoints with Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, and CNBC. Fixes the long-standing `count: 0` bug on `financial_news`. *(PR [#33](https://github.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp/pull/33) — merged)*
- **TA throttle** — caps concurrent `tradingview_ta` calls (default 4) + min 0.8s spacing between starts. Prevents parallel bursts of `combined_analysis` / `multi_timeframe_analysis` from hitting TradingView's empty-body rate-limit cliff. Tunable via env vars. *(PR [#34](https://github.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp/pull/34) — merged)*
- **Walk-forward backtesting** (`walk_forward_backtest_strategy`) — train/test split with overfitting verdict (ROBUST / MODERATE / WEAK / OVERFITTED).
- **Hourly (1h) timeframe** support across `backtest_strategy`, `compare_strategies`, and `walk_forward_backtest_strategy`.
- **Full trade log + equity curve** outputs (`include_trade_log=True`, `include_equity_curve=True`).

## 🚀 Quick Start (5 Minutes)

**Two ways to run it — the same 37 tools either way:**

| | 🧑‍💻 Self-host (this repo) | ☁️ Hosted — [pro.cryptosieve.com](https://pro.cryptosieve.com) |
|---|---|---|
| **Price** | Free forever (MIT) | $9/mo Pro · $29/mo Pro+ · 3-day trial |
| **Time to first call** | ~5 minutes (Python + `uv`) | ~60 seconds (paste one URL) |
| **Updates & ops** | You run and update it | Managed — always on the latest |
| **Runs on** | Your machine or VPS | Hosted, streamed from the edge |
| **Limits** | Your hardware | 2,500/mo · 60/min (Pro) → 10,000/mo · 150/min (Pro+) |
| **Best for** | Tinkerers, forkers, full control | Folks who'd rather skip the ops |

> ☁️ **Zero setup:** paste one connector URL into Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Copilot, or Cursor → **[start a 3-day free trial](https://pro.cryptosieve.com)**. Everything below is for self-hosting.

### Install via pip
```bash
pip install tradingview-mcp-server
```

### Optional: news & sentiment (free Marketaux key)

`financial_news` and `market_sentiment` (plus the news/sentiment parts of
`combined_analysis`) are powered by [Marketaux](https://www.marketaux.com/) —
licensed market news with per-entity sentiment. Grab a **free API key**
(100 requests/day; the server caches for 4h and shares one fetch between news
and sentiment, so the free tier goes a long way) and set:

```bash
export MARKETAUX_API_TOKEN=your_token_here   # optional
```

Without a token those two tools return a friendly "not configured" note — all
other tools work normally.

### Claude Desktop Config (`claude_desktop_config.json`)

> **Note:** On macOS, GUI apps like Claude Desktop may not have `~/.local/bin` in their PATH. Use the full path to `uvx` to avoid "command not found" errors.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview": {
      "command": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/.local/bin/uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "tradingview-mcp-server", "tradingview-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On Linux, replace `/Users/YOUR_USERNAME` with `/home/YOUR_USERNAME`. On Windows, use `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\uvx.exe`.

### Codex Plugin Config

This repository also includes mcp-only Codex plugin metadata:

- `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`
- `.codex-mcp.json`

The plugin uses the same PyPI package entrypoint:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--from", "tradingview-mcp-server", "tradingview-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

After installing or enabling the Codex plugin, restart Codex so the MCP server is loaded in the next session. Depending on your Codex version, `codex mcp list` may show registered MCP servers, but tool availability should be verified in a fresh Codex session.

### Or run from source
```bash
git clone https://github.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp
cd tradingview-mcp
uv run tradingview-mcp
```

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### 🪟 Windows: `MCP error -32001: Request timed out` on first launch

Symptom — you see this in the Claude Desktop logs shortly after adding the config:

```
[tradingview] Server started and connected successfully
[tradingview] Message from client: initialize ...
[60 seconds later]
[tradingview] notifications/cancelled — reason: "MCP error -32001: Request timed out"
```

**Why it happens:** Python 3.14 is not supported yet. `uvx` downloads `tradingview-mcp-server`, creates a fresh virtualenv, and installs dependencies the first time it runs. Some native dependencies in the MCP stack do not currently publish compatible Python 3.14 wheels, so installation can fall back to source builds or fail before Claude Desktop finishes initializing the server.

**Fix — pin to Python 3.13 (has prebuilt pandas wheels):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tradingview": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["--python", "3.13", "--from", "tradingview-mcp-server", "tradingview-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

On macOS use the full path to `uvx` (see the note in Quick Start). On Windows `uvx` is typically `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin\uvx.exe`.

**Alternative — pre-install once, then let Claude Desktop reuse the cache:**

```bash
# Run in a terminal before launching Claude Desktop
uv tool install --python 3.13 tradingview-mcp-server
```

After the install finishes, start Claude Desktop with the normal config and the server will come up instantly (cache is already warm).

## ⚠️ Error Envelope Format

Tools that have adopted the structured error format return either their normal payload **or** an error envelope:

```json
{"error": {"code": "ALL_BATCHES_FAILED", "message": "All 5 batches failed; first error: JSONDecodeError(...)", "batches_attempted": 5, "batches_failed": 5, "first_error": "...", "retryable": true}}
```

**Why:** the previous `[]` / `{"error": "Analysis failed: ..."}` strings made it impossible to distinguish "no matches today" from "upstream rate-limit cliff." The new envelope is programmatically branchable by `code`, and `retryable` tells the caller whether waiting and retrying can help (upstream storms pass; a missing dependency won't fix itself).

**Full coverage** (every failure mode — upstream outage, empty symbol list, missing dependency, unexpected exception — returns an envelope, never a raw string/traceback): `top_gainers`, `top_losers`, `bollinger_scan`, `rating_filter`, `volume_breakout_scanner`, `smart_volume_scanner`.

**Partial adoption** (main error paths return envelopes): `coin_analysis`, `volume_confirmation_analysis`, `consecutive_candles_scan`, `futures_market_overview`, `futures_top_movers`, `stock_prices`, and the backtest input guards. Remaining tools migrate in batches — tracked in [#76](https://github.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp/issues/76).

**Detecting an error:**

```python
result = volume_breakout_scanner(exchange="KUCOIN")
if isinstance(result, dict) and "error" in result:
    code = result["error"]["code"]
    if result["error"].get("retryable"):
        # Wait + retry, raise alert, fall back to single-batch call, etc.
        ...
else:
    for row in result:
        ...
```

Stable codes are defined in [`core/errors.py`](src/tradingview_mcp/core/errors.py).

## 📱 Use via Telegram, WhatsApp & More (OpenClaw)

Connect this server to **Telegram, WhatsApp, Discord** and 20+ messaging platforms using [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) — a self-hosted AI gateway. **Tested & verified on Hetzner VPS (Ubuntu 24.04).**

### How It Works

> OpenClaw routes Telegram messages to an AI agent. The agent uses `trading.py` — a thin Python wrapper — to call `tradingview-mcp` functions and return formatted results. **No MCP protocol needed between OpenClaw and the server; it's a direct Python import.**

```
Telegram → OpenClaw agent (AI model) → trading.py (bash) → tradingview-mcp → Yahoo Finance
```

### Quick Setup

```bash
# 1. Install UV and tradingview-mcp
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh && source ~/.bashrc
uv tool install tradingview-mcp-server

# 2. Configure OpenClaw channels
cat > ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json << 'EOF'
{
  channels: {
    telegram: {
      botToken: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE",
    },
  },
}
EOF

# 3. Configure gateway + agent
openclaw config set gateway.mode local
openclaw config set acp.defaultAgent main

# 4. Set your AI model (choose ONE option below)
openclaw configure --section model

# 5. Install the skill + tool wrapper
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills/tradingview-mcp ~/.openclaw/tools
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp/main/openclaw/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.agents/skills/tradingview-mcp/SKILL.md
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atilaahmettaner/tradingview-mcp/main/openclaw/trading.py \
  -o ~/.openclaw/tools/trading.py && chmod +x ~/.openclaw/tools/trading.py

# 6. Start the gateway
openclaw gateway install
systemctl --user start openclaw-gateway.service
```

### Choose Your AI Model

OpenRouter is **not required** — use whichever provider you have a key for:

| Provider | Model ID for OpenClaw | Get Key |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **OpenRouter** (aggregator — access to all models) | `openrouter/google/gemini-3-flash-preview` | [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys) |
| **Anthropic** (Claude direct) | `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` | [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) |
| **Google** (Gemini direct) | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` | [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com) |
| **OpenAI** (GPT direct) | `openai/gpt-4o-mini` | [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) |

```bash
# Examples — set your chosen model:
openclaw config set agents.defaults.model "openrouter/google/gemini-3-flash-preview"  # via OpenRouter
openclaw config set agents.defaults.model "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5"               # Anthropic direct
openclaw config set agents.defaults.model "google/gemini-2.5-flash"                   # Google direct
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Prefix must match your provider. `google/...` needs a Google API key. `openrouter/...` needs an OpenRouter key.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Unrecognized keys: mcpServers` | `mcpServers` not supported in this version | Remove from config, use bash wrapper |
| `No API key for provider "google"` | Used `google/model` but only have OpenRouter key | Use `openrouter/google/model` instead |
| `which agent?` loop | `acp.defaultAgent` not set | `openclaw config set acp.defaultAgent main` |
| Gateway won't start | `gateway.mode` missing | `openclaw config set gateway.mode local` |

### Test Your Bot

Once running, send your Telegram bot:
```
market snapshot
backtest RSI strategy for AAPL, 1 year
compare all strategies for BTC-USD
```

Unlike basic screeners, this framework deploys **specialized AI agents** that debate findings in real-time:

1. **🛠️ Technical Analyst** — Bollinger Bands (±3 proprietary rating), RSI, MACD
2. **🌊 Sentiment & Momentum Analyst** — Reddit community sentiment + price momentum
3. **🛡️ Risk Manager** — Volatility, drawdown risk, mean-reversion signals

*Output: `STRONG BUY` / `BUY` / `HOLD` / `SELL` / `STRONG SELL` with confidence score*

### 💰 Yahoo Finance — Real-Time Prices *(New in v0.6.0)*

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `yahoo_price` | Real-time quote: price, change %, 52w high/low, market state |
| `market_snapshot` | Global overview: S&P500, NASDAQ, VIX, BTC, ETH, EUR/USD, SPY, GLD |

---

### 🌍 Global Stock Screener — Common & Preferred Shares

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `stock_screener` | List common or preferred stocks for any TradingView country market (america, korea, germany, brazil, …) with price, currency, % change, dividend yield — ranked by market cap. Optional **AND-combined fundamental filters** for multi-criteria screening (market cap range, revenue YoY growth, FCF, net debt/EBITDA, sector exclude, analyst-coverage proxy). The API twin of TradingView's "Common stock" / "Preferred stock" symbol-search filter. |
| `stock_prices` | Direct price lookup for specific symbols (comma-separated `EXCHANGE:SYMBOL`, e.g. `NASDAQ:NVDA, KRX:005930`) — price, currency, daily % change, with unrecognized tickers named in `not_found`. |

**Fundamental filter params** (all optional, AND-combined; verified against live `scanner.tradingview.com` metainfo):

| Param | Scanner field | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| `market_cap_min` / `market_cap_max` | `market_cap_basic` | USD |
| `revenue_growth_yoy_min` | `total_revenue_yoy_growth_ttm` | Percent (15 = +15% YoY TTM) |
| `fcf_positive` / `fcf_min` | `free_cash_flow_ttm` | USD; `fcf_min` wins if both set |
| `net_debt_to_ebitda_max` | `net_debt_to_ebitda_fq` | Exclude banks/insurers via `sector_exclude` |
| `sector_exclude` | `sector` | e.g. `["Finance"]` |
| `analyst_count_max` | `recommendation_total` | Proxy only — see limitations |

**Known API gaps / fragility**

- There is **no** dedicated `number_of_analysts` field; `recommendation_total` (buy+hold+sell+over+under) is the closest proxy exposed as `analyst_count`.
- There is **no** standalone FCF-yield field; when fundamentals are requested the response includes `price_free_cash_flow_ttm` (P/FCF) instead.
- This tool calls TradingView's **undocumented** scanner endpoint (`https://scanner.tradingview.com/<market>/scan`). Field names, operators, or access can change or be rate-limited without notice — treat as a known breakage point for automation.

---
